## Create and train custom locomotion robot with ML Agents and Gym


This spider was created in Unity using [ArticulationBody](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html) physics, which creates realistic interactions. 
Despite its cartoonish appearance, the spider's gait is not controlled by animation or pre-written code, but by a neural network that was trained using reinforcement learning algorithms.
